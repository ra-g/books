# Book Search

This application allows you to search for books. The application uses the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview). It has the following features:
* Type in a query and display a list of books matching that query.
* Each item in the list includes the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book if available.
* From each list item, you could navigate to more information about the book.
